# Monitoring of RTI Connext DDS with Prometheus

## Overview and demonstration

---

# Data Distribution Service

> The Data Distribution Service (DDS) for real-time systems is an Object Management Group (OMG) machine-to-machine (sometimes called middleware or connectivity framework) standard that aims to enable dependable, high-performance, interoperable, real-time, scalable data exchanges using a publish‚Äìsubscribe pattern.

# RTI Connext DDS

> RTI Connext DDS implements the Data-Centric Publish-Subscribe (DCPS) API within the OMG‚Äôs Data Distribution Service (DDS) for Real-Time Systems. DDS is the first standard developed for the needs of real-time systems. DCPS provides an efficient way to transfer data in a distributed system.

---

# Monitoring Library

* Can be dynamically loaded and attached to RTI Connext DDS libraries
* Reads data from the core libraries and writes them to defined topics
* Several configuration parameters available, e.g. how often data is written
* RTI Monitor can read and show the monitoring data

# Monitoring of Routing Service

* If enabled, Routing Service writes monitoring data to defined topics
* Several configuration parameters available, e.g. how often data is written
* RTI Admin Console can read and show the monitoring data

# ![h:48](images/PrometheusLogo.png) Prometheus

> Prometheus, a Cloud Native Computing Foundation project, is a systems and service monitoring system. It collects metrics from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions, displays the results, and can trigger alerts if some condition is observed to be true.

# ![h:48](images/GrafanaLogo.svg) Grafana

> Grafana is an open source, feature rich metrics dashboard and graph editor for Graphite, Elasticsearch, OpenTSDB, Prometheus and InfluxDB.

# Architecture

![h:500](https://prometheus.io/assets/architecture.png)

---

# Collector - Data Flow

![](images/PrometheusCollectors.svg)

* Collector subscribes to DDS topics to receive the monitoring data
* Collector converts monitoring data into prometheus metrics (with labels)
* Prometheus is scraping the collector regularly to read metrics

---

# Collector - Metric example

```
# HELP dds_routing_service_process_uptime_seconds Time in seconds elapsed since the running service process started.
# TYPE dds_routing_service_process_uptime_seconds gauge
dds_routing_service_process_uptime_seconds{routing_service="default",} 301.0
```

# RTI Shapes Demo

* Usage to improve understanding
* Usage for compatibility tests
* Repository dds-examples provides the following console applications:
  * ShapePublisher
  * ShapeSubscriber

# Deployment - Kubernetes Structure

![bg right auto h:650](images/Kubernetes_Structure.svg)

* Keepalived + HAProxy for load balancing of control plane
* metallb for external access to services (in L2 mode)
* rook-ceph for storage
* local docker-registry for images

# Conclusions

* ‚úÖ Separation of monitoring, alerting from business logic
* ‚õî Additional DDS traffic is generated for monitoring
* ‚õî Prometheus does not support text, so information like QoS cannot be tracked
* ü§î Revisit of labels to be used (new set of labels create a new series)
* ü§î Usage of collector as side-car to have a more clear mapping to pods

---

# Outlook / Ideas

* having RTI Monitoring Library with configurable / customizable adapters would be great

This would allow to e.g. provide a direct Prometheus interface on-top of the library removing the need to publish additional data via DDS. Another plus would be the fact, that Prometheus would exactly track the mapping of data to pods.
